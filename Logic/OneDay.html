            The song was created in 20 minutes according to Logic in an interview with HardKnockTV, where he also explains why he released this as the first single for his then upcoming album:
            It was the most positive. To me that is the quintessential ‘Young Sinatra,’ happy vibe, dope, I got those. There's a lot of fans who felt that vibe as well… If there's anything I want to represent this album, it would definitely be ["One Day"]
            The song's accompanying music video premiered on August 17, 2018, on Logic's Vevo channel on YouTube.[3] The music video was, like the 1-800-273-8255 video, directed by Andy Hines. The main cast consisted of Luis Guzmán, Judy Reyes and Michael Peña. The video depicts the life of a child who was separated from his family at the border between Mexico and the United States. He becomes a doctor and saves the life of a white supremacist.
